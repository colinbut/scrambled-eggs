Scrambled Eggs
=====

This is a very small and inefficient program that reassembles a given set of text fragments back into their original sequence. 
The main method accepts one argument (the path to a well-formed UTF-8 encoded text file). It reads each line, processes it and prints it to the console - the corresponding defragmented output.

Each line contains text fragments separated by a semicolon, ‘;’ with every fragment has length at least 2.
